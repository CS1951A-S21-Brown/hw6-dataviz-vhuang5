                    For Extra Credit: I implemented statistical analysis in my second graph where, for each genre X I calculated the percentage of X genre games sold 
                    compared to the total game sales of said region. This is statistical because it gives information on how the proportion of each genre compared to 
                    the whole population of genres, this can give extra information to users by telling them not only which genre is the most popular, but also the magnitude
                    of how popular it is compared to other genres.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 12px;" > 
                    1) For question 1, I implemented a bar graph which was an appropriate choice to show the top ten most popular games. I just took the top 10 games from the csv file because the games
                    are already sorted from greatest to least in terms of global sales. The bar graph allows the user to see the top ten games and how each compares to the rest of the top ten. Note that
                    I counted the games with the same name but different consoles as seperate entities.<br>
                    2) For question 2 I implemented a pie graph in which the user can consider a custom number of games in which to find most popular genre by region and which
                    region the pie graph displays. The reason I chose a pie graph was because I not only wanted to show which genre was the most popular in the region, but also
                    how that genre compared to the rest of the genres in the region. This is important because sometimes there may be a very clear dominant genre while other cases 
                    (depending on region and number of video games considered) there won't be. I define "popular" by the total number of sales in the selected region. I define popularity
                    by global sales in this case.

                <p style="font-size: 12px;" > 
                    1) D3's interactive elements allowed me to display a tooltip in graphs 2 and 3 which display alot of information about each slice of the pie graphs (statistics, labels, quantities etc.)<br>
                    2) D3 allowed for toggling of graphs which gave users alot of freedom to display the information valuable to them (which region they would like/which genre they would like)<br>
                    3) D3 was a great tool in terms of creating clean graphs with clean transitions, aesthetically the information is pleasing to look at and readable
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 12px;" > 
                    1) For simple static graphs, I feel that using a different method of data visualization (python libraries) is much simpler and intuitive to use <br>
                    2) You also need to have some knowledge of html and web design in order to fully take advantage of D3, this could inhibit some people<br>
                    3) You need to manually design each component of each graph, this is time consuming but worth it if you need a large degree of customization. Otherwise
                    it is tedious
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 12px;" > 
                    4) In “A Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization,” a great deal of emphasis was put on accessibility for those with visual impairments. This means
                    picking a color palate that caters towards those with color-blindness. Those with only color blindness could easily navigate my dashboard due to my 
                    choice of colors as well as tooltips in case a specific color is easily confused with another. I also seperated bars, slices of each graph in order to allow color-blind
                    users to better differentiate between bars/slices. However, those who are completely blind would find it difficult
                    to use text to speach programs to navigate my dashboard. Graphs 2 and 3 have toggle elements which are not buttons, but rather custom inputs. If I were to make
                    the dashboard easier but less aesthetically pleasing I would add buttons for every possible genre in graph 3, this way the blind user could iterate through
                    each button for all the possible genres and have text to speach assistance reading each option to them. 
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 12px;" > 
                    5) When designing the interactive capabilities of the graphs, I have created alternative methods, such as more buttons, to guide text
                    to speach users better than the custom inputs I have right now. However, this is a tradeoff between aesthetics and inclusiveness, which should not
                    be a debate but if I were pushing this dashboard I would simply have two versions, one with more button options and one without. Furthermore,
                    I could have included tooltips on the bar graph to help vision impaired users get more info about each bar, the reason I did not was simply
                    out of time constraint.
